## Problem Situation 

This year, in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga, five companies in the automotive sector have joined forces to improve their sales and customer service. To achieve this, they proposed sharing processes from their CRM (Customer Relationship Management) / ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems to coordinate the sale of cars, spare parts, and accessories, as well as customer service, repairs, and workshop services.

The TOTES BGA consortium, as established in the agreement, has specified the following:

FIRST. The participating companies must certify a common technological environment to ensure the stability required for process integration. Therefore, consortium members must have or implement a CRM/ERP system that adapts to the new shared processes. Additionally, the technological infrastructure must support Dual-Stack communication with DHCP, DNS, NAT, HTTPS, FTPS, EMAIL, and VoIP services.

SECOND. The business model will be governed by the following processes:

1. The process of selling automobiles will be managed by dealerships and the manufacturing company (parent company).

2. Every time a car is sold, the sales information must be reported to the authorized workshop and the parent company if it is sold by a dealership.

3. The parent company is responsible for importing vehicles and delivering them to the dealership or directly to customers.

4. The workshop coordinates the maintenance, repair, and warranty programs for vehicles sold by the dealerships and the parent company.

5. The consortium shares customer information among its members so that each organization can offer marketing campaigns via email and manage after-sales services. This action, as well as data processing, will be permitted and regulated according to the personal data policy established in the customer contract. This activity is subject to Law 1581 of 2012 and Decree 1081 of 2015 in Colombia.

6. The sales of different products and services are managed between consortium members through purchase orders.

7. Once an order is approved, the products are in transit until the process is closed and cannot be assigned to another requester.

8. Product inventories are shared through authorized interfaces so that each consortium member can offer a comprehensive service.

9. The administration, inventory control, and financial management are the responsibility of each consortium company.

10. All business activities managed in the information systems must ensure a basic level of reliability, integrity, availability, authentication, and non-repudiation.

11. Internet access is managed by the parent company.

12. Communication must ensure an asynchronous medium (email) and a synchronous medium (VoIP).
